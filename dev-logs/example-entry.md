# Dev Log Entry - Getting Started with Radical Software

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Course:** DIG-345 Radical Software  
**Week/Module:** Week 1 - Introduction

## Overview

This is an example dev log entry demonstrating how to document learning throughout the Radical Software course. This entry covers the setup of the dev logs repository and the importance of documentation in software development.

## What I Learned

Documentation is a critical part of the software development process. By maintaining regular dev logs, I can:

1. **Reinforce Learning**: Writing about concepts in my own words helps cement understanding
2. **Track Progress**: Looking back at previous entries shows how far I've come
3. **Problem Solving**: Documenting challenges and solutions creates a personal knowledge base
4. **Communication**: Clear documentation helps share ideas with others

### Key Concepts

- Version control with Git for tracking changes
- Markdown formatting for creating readable documentation
- Structured approach to documenting learning
- Integration of text, code, and media for comprehensive documentation

## Implementation/Practice

Set up the repository structure with folders for dev logs and assets:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p dev-logs assets

# Copy template for new entry
cp TEMPLATE.md dev-logs/2026-01-28-getting-started.md
```

## Visual Documentation

Images and screenshots can be added to the `/assets/` folder and referenced like this:

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Organizing Dev Logs
- **Problem:** Deciding how to organize and name dev log files
- **Solution:** Used date-based naming (YYYY-MM-DD-topic) for chronological ordering

### Challenge 2: Template Structure
- **Problem:** Creating a flexible but comprehensive template
- **Solution:** Included common sections while keeping it adaptable for different types of entries

## Reflections

Starting with a clear structure makes it easier to maintain consistent documentation throughout the course. The template provides guidance without being too restrictive, allowing for different types of content while maintaining organization.

Questions for further exploration:
- What tools or techniques make documentation more effective?
- How can I integrate visual thinking and sketching into dev logs?
- What's the best balance between detail and brevity?

## Resources

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Comprehensive Markdown syntax reference
- [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/) - Version control best practices

## Next Steps

- Create dev log entries for each major topic or project
- Experiment with different media types (diagrams, videos, code snippets)
- Develop a regular practice of documenting learning after each class or work session
