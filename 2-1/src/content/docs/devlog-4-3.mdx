# DevLog 4-3: Big Feelings, MongoDB, and Vercel Deployment

## Project Overview

I forked the criticalwebdesign/big-feelings-starter and updated it per Module 10.3.

## Key Accomplishments

- Modify the project structure, install dependencies, and run the project.
- Create a MongoDB Database (CWD 10.4)
- Create an .ENV file, add your connection credentials, and test your database connection (CWD 10.4)
- Add routes to get data from MongoDB (CWD 10.4)
- Allow Visitors to Submit Feelings (CWD 10.4)
- Add an environment variable and deploy your project on Vercel. (CWD 10.4)

## Reading Response for ICE Is Going on a Surveillance Shopping Spree

**Article:** *ICE Is Going on a Surveillance Shopping Spree* (EFF 2026)

**Summary:** ICE is getting increasingly more funding and this funding is getting spent through accumulating public's data such as phone number, location, etc. These data are used to profile individuals through comopanies like Palantir and they don't only pose a risk for immigrants but at the same time a lot of citizens and activists are in danger too. The article also highlights some practices to reduce exposure to surveillance and suggests having more robust policies and law around making sure of public safety.

**Quote:** "On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don't like for reasons that you disagree with."

**Comment:** Building malicious software should be avoided at all costs as building such strong foundational infrastructure are usually irrevertible actions and can cause more harm than good.

**Discussion question:** This article reminded me of the potential of malicious AI models that can have bias and misalignment. What are some practices and policies to consider while training AI models, keeping alignment in mind?

## What I Learned

- I learned about how to use dynamic maps in the UI ([10.2 interactive maps](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-10/10-2-interactive-maps/))
- I learned about setting up Clusters (databases) in MongoDB ([10.3 data and maps](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-10/10-3-data-and-maps/))
- I learned about building APIs with MongoDB's object relational mapping ([10.4 big-feelings](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/wiki/chapter-10/10-4-big-feelings/))
- I learned about allowing access IPs on MongoDB while deploying Mongo projects to Vercel
