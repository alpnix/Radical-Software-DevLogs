1. Read 📚 Chapter 9 in Critical Web Design. ✏️ Write a reflection about the Context for this chapter.
- Looking pure amount of data that exists in the internet and transform with every request has been quite insightful for thinking about application ideas. 
- Using more of browser and developer tools could yield much more info about what's happening between the requests. 
2. Fork an existing Github project (criticalwebdesign/bad-password-api-starter) (CWD 9.3)
3. Connect to a remote API and use JSON data in a frontend (CWD 9.3)
4. Modify the project structure, install dependencies, and run the project. (CWD 9.4)
5. Add static and dynamic API routes using Express. (CWD 9.4)
6. Create a free Vercel account (CWD 9.4)
7. Deploy your project on Vercel. (CWD 9.4) Paste the link here: https://alpnix-bad-password-5o6pdkzgy-alp-niksarlis-projects.vercel.app
8. Read 📚 Hacktivist deletes white supremacist websites live onstage during hacker conference, TechCrunch 2026 Post a reading response in your DevLog per information in the Assignments.
- Summary: At the 39C3 hacker conference in Hamburg, a hacktivist known as "Martha Root" performed a live, remote deletion of three white supremacist platforms: WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal. Beyond simply taking the sites offline, Root exposed critical security vulnerabilities, specifically noting that the sites failed to strip geolocation metadata from user photos, effectively leaking the home addresses of their members. The hack involved using AI chatbots to bypass racial verification protocols and resulted in a 100GB dataset handed over to DDoSecrets for journalistic investigation.
- Quote: "They publicly delete all my websites while the audience rejoices. This is cyberterrorism."
- Comment: The most striking technical aspect of this breach is the use of AI chatbots to bypass verification. It highlights a growing trend where Large Language Models (LLMs) are being repurposed as social engineering tools to infiltrate closed communities. Furthermore, the failure of these sites to strip EXIF data (metadata) from images serves as a stark reminder that "identity-focused" platforms often lack the foundational security infrastructure to actually protect the identities of their users, leading to high-stakes "doxing" (de-anonymization).
- Discussion Question: Is it okay to break the law to stop 'bad' people online, or does that just make the internet more dangerous for everyone?
- Related Work: The Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) Archive, DDoSecrets is a nonprofit whistleblower collective that acts as a permanent repository for leaked data in the public interest.
- Reflection: Much like the "WhiteLeaks" mentioned in the article, DDoSecrets represents the intersection of technology, journalism, and activism. It serves as a digital library for data that would otherwise be lost or hidden. In the context of the 39C3 hack, DDoSecrets acts as the "ethical filter"—by not releasing the 100GB dataset to the general public but instead offering it to verified researchers, they attempt to balance the need for public accountability with the potential harm of raw data exposure.
9. Write a reflection explaining what you learned in your DevLog. Link to sources. ✏️
- I learned much more about how to create a backend API within an application and access dynamic routing. 
- I learned more about using Vercel CLI and how to deploy to Vercel without linking a Git repo so that it doesn't get built everytime I push content.
10. Publish it and turn it in by posting the direct link to this DevLog on Moodle.
