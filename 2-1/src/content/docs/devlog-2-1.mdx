# DevLog 2-1: Starlight Customization

## What I changed
I learned a little bit more about the Astro framework and its capabilities, mainly around the Starlight customization. I also updated certain CSS styles, added components, and inserted content as a part of my learning journey. I made use of the information here: https://starlight.astro.build/guides/customization/

### Config updates
- Enabled edit links that point to the `2-1/` directory on GitHub.
- Added a DevLogs section in the sidebar with placeholder guide and referencce links

### Theme styling
Custom CSS is loaded from `src/styles/custom.css` and includes Tailwind v4 utilities plus updated color tokens.

## Astro component usage
To satisfy the requirement to import and use an Astro component, I created a reusable `Highlight` component and used it below.

<Highlight title="Component Check">
This callout is rendered by a custom Astro component imported into MDX.
It uses Tailwind utility classes for spacing, borders, and color.
</Highlight>
