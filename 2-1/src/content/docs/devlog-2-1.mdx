# DevLog 2-1: Starlight Customization

## What I changed
I followed the Starlight customization guide and updated the site configuration and styling to better match this DevLog site. Reference: https://starlight.astro.build/guides/customization/

### Config updates
- Added a logo using the existing `houston.webp` asset.
- Enabled edit links that point to the `2-1/` directory on GitHub.
- Tuned the global table of contents to include H2 and H3 headings.
- Added a DevLogs section in the sidebar for quick navigation.

### Theme styling
Custom CSS is loaded from `src/styles/custom.css` and includes Tailwind v4 utilities plus updated color tokens.

## Astro component usage
To satisfy the requirement to import and use an Astro component, I created a reusable `Highlight` component and used it below.

<Highlight title="Component Check">
This callout is rendered by a custom Astro component imported into MDX.
It uses Tailwind utility classes for spacing, borders, and color.
</Highlight>

## Next steps
- Add the reading response for the Heydon Pickering talk.
- Expand this DevLog with reflection and source links.
