# DevLog 2-1: Starlight Customization

## What I changed
I learned a little bit more about the Astro framework and its capabilities, mainly around the Starlight customization. I also updated certain CSS styles, added components, and inserted content as a part of my learning journey. I made use of the information here: https://starlight.astro.build/guides/customization/

### Config updates
- Enabled edit links that point to the `2-1/` directory on GitHub.
- Added a DevLogs section in the sidebar with placeholder guide and referencce links

### Theme styling
Custom CSS is loaded from `src/styles/custom.css` and includes Tailwind v4 utilities plus updated color tokens.

## Astro component usage
To satisfy the requirement to import and use an Astro component, I created a reusable `Highlight` component and used it below.

<Highlight title="Component Check">
This callout is rendered by a custom Astro component imported into MDX.
It uses Tailwind utility classes for spacing, borders, and color.
</Highlight>

## Other reflection
- I watched the video by Heydon Pickering, and here is my reading response.
 - Summary: Everything we see in our computers are made up of binary values. In fact, this is not only limited our computers and can be observed in most places around us in the world.
 - Quote: "It's not the binary in your computer at fault, it's the binary we ascribe to our brains."
 - Comment: I resonated quite a bit with the two personality types like "doing but not thinking about what or why" and "thinking but not worrying about how to implement"
 - Question: In a world where every category is divided into binary sections, how can we optimize for the compatibility between the two groups?
