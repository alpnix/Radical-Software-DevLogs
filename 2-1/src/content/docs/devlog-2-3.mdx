# DevLog 2-3: Astro features haven't explored before

## Key Accomplishments
- I was able to set up an environment on Netlify and submit the sub-directory that I just wanted to deploy. 
- I used Astro's file-based routing to create dynamic blog post pages with `[post].astro`.
- I created reusable layout components with `<slot />` to inject markdown content into a consistent page structure.
- I set up frontmatter in markdown files to define metadata like title, description, and publication date.
- I implemented `getStaticPaths()` to generate static routes from markdown files in the blog directory.
- I configured the project to use `BlogLayout.astro` for consistent styling and structure across all blog posts.
