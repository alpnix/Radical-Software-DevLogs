# Radical Software DevLogs - DIG-345

This repository contains development logs for the **DIG-345 Radical Software** course.

## About Dev Logs

Throughout this course, I will write about and document what I learn, adding text, images, and other media to reinforce concepts. Describing new materials in my own words not only increases learning, but allows me to:

- **Track progress** throughout the course
- **Debug** design and technical challenges
- **Share** design and technical solutions
- **Reinforce concepts** learned in class

## Structure

- `/dev-logs/` - Contains individual dev log entries organized chronologically
- `/assets/` - Contains images, videos, and other media referenced in dev logs
- `TEMPLATE.md` - Template for creating new dev log entries

## How to Use

1. Create a new dev log entry using the template:
   ```bash
   cp TEMPLATE.md dev-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md
   ```

2. Fill in the dev log with:
   - What you learned
   - Code snippets or examples
   - Images, diagrams, or screenshots
   - Reflections and insights
   - Questions or challenges

3. Add any media files to the `/assets/` directory

4. Commit and push your changes
